# 🐍 Snake: Remastered 

An upgraded take on the classic Snake Game, built with Python (Pygame).

## 🔧 Features :

➜ **Custom snake design** with gradient colors, head & tail details

➜ **Multiple fruits & power-ups** (shield & slow-motion)

➜ **Obstacles & level progression** with unique backgrounds (forest, desert, space)
